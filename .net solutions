- **Unified Development**: With .NET Core, you can develop web, mobile, desktop, cloud, and IoT applications.

### 3. **What is Dependency Injection in .NET Core? How is it implemented?**

**Answer:**

- **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. It allows for loose coupling between components.
- **Implementation in .NET Core**:
    - Configure services in the `Startup.cs` file using `ConfigureServices` method.
    - Use the built-in IoC container to inject dependencies via constructors or properties.
    
    Example:
    
    ```csharp
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
    }
    
    ```
    

### 4. **What are Middleware components in .NET Core?**

**Answer:**

- **Middleware** are software components that are assembled into an application pipeline to handle requests and responses.
- They are executed in sequence. Each middleware component can either pass the request to the next component or terminate the request pipeline.
- Middleware is added to the `Startup.Configure` method.
    
    Example:
    
    ```csharp
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseRouting();
        app.UseAuthentication();
        app.UseAuthorization();
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
        });
    }
    
    ```
    

### 5. **What is the significance of `Startup.cs` in a .NET Core application?**

**Answer:**

- The `Startup.cs` file is essential in configuring the request pipeline and services for the application.
- It contains two methods:
    - `ConfigureServices`: Registers services with the DI container.
    - `Configure`: Defines the middleware pipeline that handles requests.

### 6. **What are the different ways to configure services in .NET Core?**

**Answer:**

- Services can be registered in the `ConfigureServices` method of `Startup.cs`.
- There are three lifetimes:
    - **Transient**: Created each time they are requested.
    - **Scoped**: Created once per request.
    - **Singleton**: Created once and shared throughout the application's lifetime.

### 7. **What is Entity Framework Core (EF Core)?**

**Answer:**

- **EF Core** is an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for .NET Core. It allows developers to work with a database using .NET objects, eliminating the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.
- It supports LINQ queries, change tracking, updates, and schema migrations.

### 8. **How do you implement authentication and authorization in .NET Core?**

**Answer:**

- **Authentication** is the process of verifying who a user is.
- **Authorization** is the process of determining whether a user has permission to access a resource.
- **Implementation**:
    - Use `Identity` or third-party libraries like `JWT` for authentication.
    - Add `Authorize` attribute to controllers or actions for authorization.
    
    Example:
    
    ```csharp
    [Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
    public IActionResult AdminDashboard()
    {
        return View();
    }
    
    ```
    

### 9. **How do you handle configuration in .NET Core?**

**Answer:**

- Configuration in .NET Core is typically handled via `appsettings.json`, environment variables, or the `IConfiguration` interface.
- Use the `Configuration` property in `Startup.cs` to access configuration values.
    
    Example:
    
    ```json
    {
      "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;"
      }
    }
    
    ```
    
    Accessing it:
    
    ```csharp
    var connectionString = Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection");
    
    ```
    

### 10. **What is Kestrel in .NET Core?**

**Answer:**

- **Kestrel** is a cross-platform web server included and enabled by default in .NET Core applications. It is known for being lightweight and fast.
- It can be used as an edge server or behind another server like IIS, Nginx, or Apache.
