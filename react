Here's a list of 50 frequently asked React interview questions along with concise answers that are suitable for a developer with around 2 years of experience.

### 1. **What is React?**

- **Answer:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where data is dynamically updated without reloading the page.

### 2. **What are the features of React?**

- **Answer:** Some key features include JSX, virtual DOM, component-based architecture, and one-way data binding.

### 3. **What is JSX?**

- **Answer:** JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML or XML. It allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript and makes the syntax easier to read and write React components.

### 4. **What is the Virtual DOM?**

- **Answer:** The Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM elements generated by React components. React updates the virtual DOM first, then compares it with the real DOM and applies only the necessary changes.

### 5. **Explain the component lifecycle in React.**

- **Answer:** React components have lifecycle methods that you can override to run code at specific times in the process of mounting, updating, and unmounting a component. Key methods include `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

### 6. **What are functional components?**

- **Answer:** Functional components are simple functions in React that accept props as an argument and return React elements (JSX). They do not manage their own state or lifecycle methods without the help of hooks.

### 7. **What are class components?**

- **Answer:** Class components are ES6 classes that extend from `React.Component` and have a render method that returns React elements. They can manage their own state and lifecycle methods.

### 8. **What is state in React?**

- **Answer:** State is an object that holds data that may change over the lifetime of the component. It is managed within the component and determines how the component renders and behaves.

### 9. **What is the difference between state and props?**

- **Answer:** State is managed within the component, while props are inputs to the component and are passed down from a parent component. Props are immutable, whereas the state can be updated using `setState` or the `useState` hook.

### 10. **What are React Hooks?**

- **Answer:** React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features (like lifecycle methods) in functional components. Common hooks include `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc.

### 11. **What is `useState`?**

- **Answer:** `useState` is a React Hook that allows you to add state to functional components. It returns an array with two elements: the current state and a function to update it.

### 12. **What is `useEffect`?**

- **Answer:** `useEffect` is a React Hook that lets you perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. It runs after every render by default.

### 13. **Explain the importance of keys in lists.**

- **Answer:** Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed. They should be unique and stable, ensuring that the list items preserve their identity across renders.

### 14. **What is prop drilling?**

- **Answer:** Prop drilling is the process of passing props down multiple levels of a component tree. It can lead to complex and hard-to-manage code, so techniques like context or state management libraries are used to avoid it.

### 15. **What is Context API?**

- **Answer:** The Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It’s useful for global state management in small to medium-sized applications.

### 16. **What is Redux?**

- **Answer:** Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It helps manage application state in a predictable way and works particularly well with React.

### 17. **What are actions in Redux?**

- **Answer:** Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe a change in the state. They have a `type` property that indicates the type of action being performed and can carry additional data.

### 18. **What are reducers in Redux?**

- **Answer:** Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state. They determine how the state should change in response to an action.

### 19. **What is a store in Redux?**

- **Answer:** The store is a central repository in Redux that holds the entire state of the application. It’s the only source of truth for the state in a Redux application.

### 20. **Explain `connect` in Redux.**

- **Answer:** `connect` is a function provided by `react-redux` that connects a React component to the Redux store. It lets you access the state and dispatch actions from your components.

### 21. **What is the difference between `useEffect` and `componentDidMount`?**

- **Answer:** `componentDidMount` is a lifecycle method in class components that runs after the component is mounted, while `useEffect` can be used in functional components to mimic `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

### 22. **What are higher-order components (HOC)?**

- **Answer:** Higher-order components are functions that take a component as an argument and return a new component with additional props or behavior. HOCs are used for code reuse and adding cross-cutting concerns.

### 23. **What is the purpose of React Router?**

- **Answer:** React Router is a library that enables navigation between different views or pages in a React application. It allows for declarative routing and provides components like `Route`, `Link`, and `Switch`.

### 24. **What is lazy loading in React?**

- **Answer:** Lazy loading is the technique of loading components or resources only when they are needed, reducing the initial load time of an application. React provides `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` for lazy loading components.

### 25. **What are controlled components?**

- **Answer:** Controlled components are form elements (like `<input>`, `<textarea>`) in React whose values are controlled by React state. Every time the user types, the state is updated, and the component re-renders with the new state.

### 26. **What are uncontrolled components?**

- **Answer:** Uncontrolled components are form elements that maintain their own internal state. Instead of being controlled by React state, you use refs to access their current values.

### 27. **What is the difference between `React.Fragment` and a `<div>`?**

- **Answer:** `React.Fragment` allows you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM, unlike a `<div>`, which creates an additional wrapper element.

### 28. **What is PropTypes in React?**

- **Answer:** PropTypes is a way to enforce type checking in React components. It helps catch bugs by ensuring that props passed to a component are of the correct type.

### 29. **What are React portals?**

- **Answer:** React portals allow you to render children into a DOM node outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. They are useful for things like modals or tooltips that need to break out of their parent container.

### 30. **What is the purpose of `shouldComponentUpdate`?**

- **Answer:** `shouldComponentUpdate` is a lifecycle method that determines whether a component should re-render when new props or state are received. It can be used to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

### 31. **What is React.memo?**

- **Answer:** `React.memo` is a higher-order component that wraps a functional component and memoizes its output, preventing unnecessary re-renders when the props haven’t changed.

### 32. **What is the difference between `useCallback` and `useMemo`?**

- **Answer:** `useCallback` returns a memoized version of the callback function, while `useMemo` returns a memoized value. `useCallback` is used when passing functions as props to child components to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### 33. **How do you handle errors in React?**

- **Answer:** You can handle errors in React by using error boundaries. An error boundary is a component that catches JavaScript errors in its child components and renders an alternative UI.

### 34. **What is React's `StrictMode`?**

- **Answer:** `StrictMode` is a wrapper component in React that helps identify potential problems in an application. It runs extra checks and warnings in development mode but has no impact on production builds.

### 35. **How do you optimize performance in a React application?**

- **Answer:** Some ways to optimize performance include using React.memo, `useCallback`, and `useMemo`, avoiding unnecessary re-renders, lazy loading components, and using code splitting with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.

### 36. **What is code splitting?**

- **Answer:** Code splitting is a technique used to split your code into smaller bundles that can be loaded on demand. It’s commonly done using `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to load components only when they are needed.

### 37. **Explain the concept of "lifting state up."**

- **Answer:** "Lifting state up" refers to the practice of moving state from

a child component to a parent component so that multiple children can share and update the state.

- **Answer:** The Context API is built into React and is ideal for simple or medium-sized applications. Redux is a more powerful state management library that is better suited for large applications with complex state management needs.

### 38. **What is the difference between `Context API` and `Redux`?**

### 39. **What is the difference between `React.lazy` and `React.Suspense`?**

- **Answer:** `React.lazy` is used to dynamically import a component, whereas `React.Suspense` is used to display a fallback while the component is being loaded.

### 40. **What is reconciliation in React?**

- **Answer:** Reconciliation is the process by which React updates the DOM. When the state or props change, React compares the new and old virtual DOM and updates only the parts of the DOM that changed.

### 41. **What is the significance of the `key` prop in lists?**

- **Answer:** The `key` prop helps React identify which items in a list have changed, been added, or removed. Using keys ensures that React can efficiently update the list with minimal re-renders.

### 42. **What is React's `StrictMode`?**

- **Answer:** `StrictMode` is a development mode feature in React that helps you identify potential problems in an application. It runs checks on deprecated API usage, side effects, and more.

### 43. **What is React's `Profiler`?**

- **Answer:** The `Profiler` is a React tool that measures the performance of a React application. It records the time taken by each component to render and helps identify performance bottlenecks.

### 44. **What are React's synthetic events?**

- **Answer:** Synthetic events are React's cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event system. They ensure that events behave consistently across different browsers.

### 45. **What is `useReducer` and when would you use it?**

- **Answer:** `useReducer` is a React Hook that is an alternative to `useState` for managing more complex state logic. It’s used when the state logic involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

### 46. **What are side effects in React?**

- **Answer:** Side effects are operations that affect something outside the scope of a function, like fetching data, directly manipulating the DOM, or logging. In React, side effects are handled using `useEffect`.

### 47. **What is the significance of `React.StrictMode`?**

- **Answer:** `React.StrictMode` helps identify potential problems in the application by intentionally running certain lifecycle methods twice and checking for deprecated methods, side effects, and other issues during development.

### 48. **What are portals in React?**

- **Answer:** Portals allow you to render a component's children into a different part of the DOM tree that is outside of the current component hierarchy. This is useful for modals, tooltips, and similar UI elements.

### 49. **How do you manage forms in React?**

- **Answer:** Forms in React can be managed using controlled components, where form elements are tied to the state, or uncontrolled components, where refs are used to access the form elements directly.

### 50. **What is `useRef` and how is it used?**

- **Answer:** `useRef` is a React Hook that returns a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument. It can be used to persist values across renders or to directly access DOM elements.

These questions cover a wide range of React concepts, from basic to advanced, and will help you prepare effectively for a React interview.

# Top React Interview Questions and Answers for Developers with 2 Years of Experience

React has become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. If you're preparing for a React interview with around 2 years of experience, it's essential to be well-versed in both fundamental and intermediate concepts. Below is a curated list of frequently asked React interview questions along with comprehensive answers to help you prepare effectively.

---

### 1. **What is React, and why is it used?**

**Answer:**

**React** is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building fast and interactive user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.

**Key Reasons to Use React:**

- **Component-Based Architecture:** Encourages reusability and modularity by breaking the UI into independent, reusable components.
- **Virtual DOM:** Improves performance by updating the DOM efficiently.
- **One-Way Data Binding:** Ensures that changes in data flow in a single direction, making debugging easier.
- **Rich Ecosystem:** A vast collection of tools, libraries, and community support.

---

### 2. **Explain the concept of the Virtual DOM and its benefits.**

**Answer:**

The **Virtual DOM (VDOM)** is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements generated by React components. When the state of a component changes, React updates the Virtual DOM, compares it with the previous version (a process known as **diffing**), and then updates only the changed elements in the real DOM.

**Benefits:**

- **Performance:** Minimizes direct DOM manipulations, which are costly operations, leading to improved performance.
- **Efficient Updates:** By updating only the parts of the DOM that have changed, React ensures efficient rendering.
- **Abstraction:** Developers can write code as if the entire page is re-rendered on each change, while React takes care of updating only what's necessary.

---

### 3. **Differentiate between Class Components and Functional Components.**

**Answer:**

- **Class Components:**
    - **Definition:** ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`.
    - **State Management:** Use `this.state` and `this.setState()` for managing state.
    - **Lifecycle Methods:** Have access to lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount()`, `componentDidUpdate()`, etc.
    - **Example:**
        
        ```jsx
        class Welcome extends React.Component {
          constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = { message: 'Hello' };
          }
        
          render() {
            return <h1>{this.state.message}, {this.props.name}</h1>;
          }
        }
        
        ```
        
- **Functional Components:**
    - **Definition:** JavaScript functions that return JSX.
    - **State Management:** Use React Hooks like `useState` for managing state.
    - **Lifecycle Methods:** Use Hooks like `useEffect` to mimic lifecycle methods.
    - **Example:**
        
        ```jsx
        function Welcome(props) {
          const [message, setMessage] = useState('Hello');
        
          return <h1>{message}, {props.name}</h1>;
        }
        
        ```
        

**Note:** Before Hooks were introduced in React 16.8, functional components were stateless.

---

### 4. **What are React Hooks? Name a few commonly used Hooks.**

**Answer:**

**React Hooks** are functions that let you use React state and lifecycle features in functional components. They allow you to manage state, perform side effects, and more without writing class components.

**Commonly Used Hooks:**

- **useState:** Allows you to add state to functional components.
    
    ```jsx
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    
    ```
    
- **useEffect:** Performs side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulations.
    
    ```jsx
    useEffect(() => {
      // side effect code
    }, [dependencies]);
    
    ```
    
- **useContext:** Accesses the React Context API.
    
    ```jsx
    const value = useContext(MyContext);
    
    ```
    
- **useReducer:** Manages complex state logic.
    
    ```jsx
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
    
    ```
    
- **useRef:** Accesses DOM elements or persists mutable values.
    
    ```jsx
    const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);
    
    ```
    

---

### 5. **Explain the purpose of the `useState` Hook with an example.**

**Answer:**

The `useState` Hook allows functional components to have state. It returns a stateful value and a function to update it.

**Example: Counter Component**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  // Declare a new state variable called 'count', initialized to 0
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      {/* Update the state by calling setCount */}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

```

In this example:

- `count` is the current state.
- `setCount` is the function that updates `count`.
- Calling `setCount` re-renders the component with the new `count` value.

---

### 6. **What is the `useEffect` Hook, and how does it replace lifecycle methods in functional components?**

**Answer:**

The `useEffect` Hook lets you perform side effects in functional components. It serves similar purposes as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in class components.

**Syntax:**

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Effect logic here (e.g., data fetching)

  return () => {
    // Cleanup logic here (e.g., removing event listeners)
  };
}, [dependencies]);

```

**Parameters:**

- **Effect Function:** A function that contains the side-effect logic.
- **Cleanup Function (Optional):** Returned by the effect function to clean up after the effect.
- **Dependency Array (Optional):** Determines when the effect should re-run.

**Example: Fetching Data on Component Mount**

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function DataFetcher() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('<https://api.example.com/data>')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []); // Empty array ensures this runs only once

  return (
    <div>
      {data ? <p>{data.title}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

```

In this example:

- The effect runs once after the component mounts due to the empty dependency array.
- The effect fetches data and updates the state.

---

### 7. **How do you pass data between React components?**

**Answer:**

- **From Parent to Child:** Use **props** to pass data.
    
    ```jsx
    function Parent() {
      const data = 'Hello Child';
      return <Child message={data} />;
    }
    
    function Child({ message }) {
      return <p>{message}</p>;
    }
    
    ```
    
- **From Child to Parent:** Pass a function from the parent as a prop to the child, and the child calls this function to pass data back.
    
    ```jsx
    function Parent() {
      const handleData = (childData) => {
        console.log(childData);
      };
      return <Child sendData={handleData} />;
    }
    
    function Child({ sendData }) {
      return <button onClick={() => sendData('Data from Child')}>Send Data</button>;
    }
    
    ```
    
- **Between Siblings:** Lift the shared state up to the closest common ancestor and pass data down as props.
- **Using Context API or State Management Libraries:** For complex scenarios, especially when avoiding prop drilling.

---

### 8. **What is prop drilling, and how can it be avoided?**

**Answer:**

**Prop Drilling** is the process where you pass data through multiple nested components that don't necessarily need the data, just to reach a deeply nested component that does.

**Example of Prop Drilling:**

```jsx
function GrandParent() {
  const data = 'Hello from GrandParent';
  return <Parent data={data} />;
}

function Parent({ data }) {
  return <Child data={data} />;
}

function Child({ data }) {
  return <p>{data}</p>;
}

```

**Ways to Avoid Prop Drilling:**

1. **Context API:** Allows you to share data globally without passing props through every level.
    
    ```jsx
    const DataContext = React.createContext();
    
    function GrandParent() {
      const data = 'Hello from GrandParent';
      return (
        <DataContext.Provider value={data}>
          <Parent />
        </DataContext.Provider>
      );
    }
    
    function Child() {
      const data = useContext(DataContext);
      return <p>{data}</p>;
    }
    
    ```
    
2. **State Management Libraries:** Use Redux, MobX, or similar libraries to manage state globally.
3. **Hooks like `useReducer` with Context:** Combine `useReducer` and Context for more complex state management.

---

### 9. **Explain the concept of Higher-Order Components (HOC) in React.**

**Answer:**

A **Higher-Order Component (HOC)** is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. It's a function that takes a component and returns a new component with enhanced capabilities.

**Syntax:**

```jsx
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);

```

**Example: Logging Props with an HOC**

```jsx
function withLogging(WrappedComponent) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      console.log('Props:', this.props);
    }

    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
}

// Usage
const EnhancedComponent = withLogging(OriginalComponent);

```

**Benefits:**

- **Code Reusability:** Share common functionality among multiple components.
- **Abstraction:** Encapsulate complex logic in HOCs, keeping components clean.

**Note:** With the introduction of Hooks, some use cases for HOCs can be addressed using custom Hooks.

---

### 10. **What are Pure Components in React?**

**Answer:**

A **Pure Component** in React is a component that performs a shallow comparison of its props and state to determine whether to re-render. If there's no change, it skips rendering, optimizing performance.

**Creating a Pure Component:**

- **Class Components:** Extend `React.PureComponent` instead of `React.Component`.
    
    ```jsx
    class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent {
      render() {
        // rendering logic
      }
    }
    
    ```
    
- **Functional Components:** Use `React.memo`.
    
    ```jsx
    const MyComponent = React.memo(function(props) {
      // rendering logic
    });
    
    ```
    

**Considerations:**

- **Shallow Comparison:** Only checks if the first-level properties are the same. Nested objects or arrays might not trigger a re-render if their reference doesn't change.
- **Immutability:** Ensure that props and state are updated immutably to benefit from Pure Components.

---

### 11. **How does React handle forms, and what is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?**

**Answer:**

**Controlled Components:**

- **Definition:** Form elements whose values are controlled by React's state.
- **Characteristics:**
    - The value of the form element is set by the component's state.
    - Any changes trigger `onChange` events, updating the state.
- **Example:**
    
    ```jsx
    class NameForm extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { value: '' };
      }
    
      handleChange = (event) => {
        this.setState({ value: event.target.value });
      };
    
      handleSubmit = (event) => {
        alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.state.value);
        event.preventDefault();
      };
    
      render() {
        return (
          <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
            <label>
              Name:
              <input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
            </label>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
          </form>
        );
      }
    }
    
    ```
    

**Uncontrolled Components:**

- **Definition:** Form elements that maintain their own internal state.
- **Characteristics:**
    - Use refs to access form values directly from the DOM.
    - Less code but sacrifices control over form data.
- **Example:**
    
    ```jsx
    class NameForm extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.input = React.createRef();
      }
    
      handleSubmit = (event) => {
        alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.input.current.value);
        event.preventDefault();
      };
    
      render() {
        return (
          <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
            <label>
              Name:
              <input type="text" ref={this.input} />
            </label>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
          </form>
        );
      }
    }
    
    ```
    

**Key Differences:**

- **Data Handling:** Controlled components rely on React state, while uncontrolled components rely on the DOM.
- **Validation and Formatting:** Easier in controlled components as all data flows through React.

---

### 12. **What are React Fragments, and why are they used?**

**Answer:**

**React Fragments** allow you to group a list of children elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. This is useful when you want to return multiple elements from a component without wrapping them in an unnecessary div or other container.

**Syntax:**

- **Using `<React.Fragment>`:**
    
    ```jsx
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <ChildA />
        <ChildB />
      </React.Fragment>
    );
    
    ```
    
- **Using Shorthand Syntax (if supported):**
    
    ```jsx
    return (
      <>
        <ChildA />
        <ChildB />
      </>
    );
    
    ```
    

**Benefits:**

- **Cleaner DOM:** Avoids adding unnecessary wrapper elements, which can complicate CSS and DOM structure.
- **Performance:** Minimizes the number of DOM nodes, which can improve performance.

---

### 13. **Explain the Context API in React.**

**Answer:**

The **Context API** provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It's useful for global data like themes, user authentication, and preferred language.

**Components of Context API:**

1. **Creating Context:**
    
    ```jsx
    const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);
    
    ```
    
2. **Provider:**
    - Wraps the part of the component tree that needs access to the context.
    - Supplies the context value.
    
    ```jsx
    <MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>
      {/* child components */}
    </MyContext.Provider>
    
    ```
    
3. **Consumer:**
    - Accesses the context value.
    
    ```jsx
    <MyContext.Consumer>
      {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
    </MyContext.Consumer>
    
    ```
    
4. **useContext Hook:**
    - Simplifies context consumption in functional components.
    
    ```jsx
    const value = useContext(MyContext);
    
    ```
    

**Example: Theme Context**

```jsx
// Create Context
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

// Provider Component
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

// Consuming Context with useContext
function Toolbar() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <div>Current Theme: {theme}</div>;
}

```

**Use Cases:**

- Theming
- User Authentication
- Localization
- Managing application-level settings

### 14. **How do you optimize performance in a React application?**

**Answer:**

- **Using Pure Components or `React.memo`:** Prevent unnecessary re-renders by implementing shouldComponentUpdate logic.
    
    ```jsx
    const MyComponent = React.memo(function(props) {
      // rendering logic
    });
    
    ```
    
- **Code Splitting with React.lazy and Suspense:** Load components lazily to reduce the initial bundle size.
    
    ```jsx
    const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));
    
    function MyComponent() {
      return (
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
          <OtherComponent />
        </Suspense>
      );
    }
    
    ```
    
- **Avoid Anonymous Functions in Render:** Define functions outside of the render method to prevent re-creation on each render.
- **Use of `useCallback` and `useMemo`:** Memoize functions and computed values to avoid unnecessary computations.
    
    ```jsx
    const memoizedCallback = useCallback(
      () => {
        doSomething(a, b);
      },
      [a, b],
    );
    
    const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
    
    ```
    
- **Windowing or List Virtualization:** Render only a small subset of data for large lists using libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized`.
- **Optimizing Images and Assets:** Use appropriate image formats and lazy loading.
- **Production Build:** Ensure that the application is built in production mode, which includes optimizations like minification and dead code elimination.

### 15. **What are Error Boundaries in React?**

**Answer:**

**Error Boundaries** are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

**Creating an Error Boundary:**

```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state to render the fallback UI
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    // Log error details
    logErrorToService(error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // Render fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}

```

**Usage:**

```jsx
<ErrorBoundary>
  <MyComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>

```

**Key Points:**

- Error Boundaries catch errors during rendering, lifecycle methods, and constructors of the entire tree below them.
- They do **not** catch errors in event handlers, async code, server-side rendering, or errors thrown in the Error Boundary itself.
- React 16 and above support Error Boundaries.

### 16. **Explain the concept of Keys in React and why they are important.**

**Answer:**

**Keys** are special string attributes used in React to identify which items in a list have changed, been added, or been removed. They help React optimize rendering by keeping track of elements.

**Usage:**

- Assign a unique key to each element in a list.
    
    ```jsx
    const listItems = items.map(item =>
      <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
    );
    
    ```
    

**Importance:**

- **Performance:** Helps React identify changes and re-render only the affected components.
- **Avoiding Bugs:** Using unique keys prevents React from mixing up components, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

**Best Practices:**

- Use stable, unique identifiers like IDs.
- Avoid using indices as keys, especially if the list can be reordered.

### 17. **How do you handle conditional rendering in React?**

**Answer:**

Conditional rendering in React determines what to display based on certain conditions.

**Methods:**

1. **Using `if` Statements:**
    
    ```jsx
    function Greeting(props) {
      if (props.isLoggedIn) {
        return <h1>Welcome back!</h1>;
      } else {
        return <h1>Please sign up.</h1>;
      }
    }
    
    ```
    
2. **Using Ternary Operators:**
    
    ```jsx
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn ? <Dashboard /> : <Login />}
    </div>
    
    ```
    
3. **Using Logical && Operator:**
    
    ```jsx
    <div>
      {messages.length > 0 && <h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.</h2>}
    </div>
    
    ```
    
4. **Conditional Rendering with IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):**
    
    ```jsx
    <div>
      {(() => {
        switch (status) {
          case 'success':
            return <SuccessComponent />;
          case 'error':
            return <ErrorComponent />;
          default:
            return <LoadingComponent />;
        }
      })()}
    </div>
    
    ```
    
5. **Using Variables:**
    
    ```jsx
    let button;
    if (isLoggedIn) {
      button = <LogoutButton />;
    } else {
      button = <LoginButton />;
    }
    
    return <div>{button}</div>;
    
    ```

### 18. **What is Redux, and how does it integrate with React?**

**Answer:**

**Redux** is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps manage the application state in a single, centralized store, making state management predictable and easier to debug.

**Core Concepts:**

- **Store:** Holds the state of the application.
- **Actions:** Plain JavaScript objects that describe changes in the state.
- **Reducers:** Pure functions that take the current state and an action, and return a new state.

**Integration with React:**

- Use the `react-redux` library, which provides:
    - **Provider:** Makes the Redux store available to the rest of the app.
        
        ```jsx
        import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
        import { createStore } from 'redux';
        
        const store = createStore(rootReducer);
        
        function App() {
          return (
            <Provider store={store}>
              <MyComponents />
            </Provider>
          );
        }
        
        ```
        
    - **`connect` Function:** Connects React components to the Redux store.
        
        ```jsx
        import { connect } from 'react-redux';
        
        const mapStateToProps = state => ({
          counter: state.counter,
        });
        
        const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
          increment: () => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' }),
        });
        
        const Counter = ({ counter, increment }) => (
          <div>
            <p>{counter}</p>
            <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
          </div>
        );
        
        export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);
        
        ```
        
    - **Hooks:** `useSelector` and `useDispatch` for functional components.
        
        ```jsx
        import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
        
        function Counter() {
          const counter = useSelector(state => state.counter);
          const dispatch = useDispatch();
        
          return (
            <div>
              <p>{counter}</p>
              <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>Increment</button>
            </div>
          );
        }
        
        ```
        

**Benefits:**

- **Predictable State Management:** Ensures that state changes are predictable due to strict rules.
- **Debugging:** Easy to track and debug state changes.
- **Time-Travel Debugging:** Ability to record and replay actions.

### 19. **Explain the concept of Refs in React.**

**Answer:**

**Refs (References)** provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method. They are useful for:

- Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.
- Triggering imperative animations.
- Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.

**Creating Refs:**

1. **Using `React.createRef`:** For class components.
    
    ```jsx
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.myRef = React.createRef();
      }
    
      componentDidMount() {
        this.myRef.current.focus();
      }
    
      render() {
        return <input type="text" ref={this.myRef} />;
      }
    }
    
    ```
    
2. **Using `useRef` Hook:** For functional components.
    
    ```jsx
    function MyComponent() {
      const inputRef = useRef(null);
    
      useEffect(() => {
        inputRef.current.focus();
      }, []);
    
      return <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />;
    }
    
    ```
    

**Accessing Refs:**

- The `current` property of the ref object points to the DOM node or React element.

**Caveats:**

- Refs should be used sparingly as they break the declarative nature of React.
- Avoid overusing refs for things that can be achieved through state and props.

### 20. **What is the difference between Element and Component in React?**

**Answer:**

- **Element:**
    - **Definition:** A plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components.
    - **Creation:** Typically created using JSX.
    - **Example:**
        
        ```jsx
        const element = <div className="greeting">Hello, world!</div>;
        
        ```
        
- **Component:**
    - **Definition:** A function or class that accepts props and returns React elements.
    - **Types:** Functional Components and Class Components.
    - **Example:**
        
        ```jsx
        function Greeting(props) {
          return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
        }
        
        class Greeting extends React.Component {
          render() {
            return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
          }
        }
        
        ```
        

**Key Differences:**

- **Purpose:** Elements are the building blocks of React applications, while components are reusable pieces that can return elements.
- **Usage:** Components can manage their own state and lifecycle, whereas elements are immutable descriptions of what should be rendered.

By thoroughly understanding and being able to articulate these concepts, you'll be well-prepared to tackle a React interview tailored for someone with around two years of experience.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/08e0b0e9-3627-41fd-915b-85c745e78ef2/c0d25c95-1f5a-4bc7-947c-c2afc4cb8e5f/image.png)

React components have several lifecycle methods that you can override to run your code at specific points in a component's lifecycle. These methods can be divided into four phases:

### 1. **Initialization Phase**

- **This phase involves setting up the component.**
- **`constructor(props)`**: This method is called before the component is mounted. It’s used to initialize the state and bind event handlers. It’s the first method that gets called when a component instance is being created.

### 2. **Mounting Phase**

- **This phase covers when a component is being added to the DOM.**
- **`componentDidMount()`**: This method is called immediately after the component is mounted (inserted into the tree). It's commonly used to fetch data from APIs or set up any subscriptions.

### 3. **Updating Phase**

- **This phase occurs when the component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to its props or state.**
- **`shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`**: This method determines whether the component should re-render or not, based on changes in props or state. It returns a boolean value. By default, it returns `true`, meaning the component will re-render. This method is useful for performance optimization.
- **`componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)`**: This method is invoked immediately after the component updates. It’s a good place to operate on the DOM when the component has been updated.

### 4. **Unmounting Phase**

- **This phase occurs when a component is being removed from the DOM.**
- **`componentWillUnmount()`**: This method is called just before the component is unmounted and destroyed. It’s used to clean up things like timers, network requests, or subscriptions created during the mounting phase.

### 5. **Error Handling Phase**

- **This phase involves catching and handling errors during rendering.**
- **`componentDidCatch(error, info)`**: This method is invoked when an error is thrown in a child component. It’s used to catch errors during the rendering, lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them. It allows you to log errors and display a fallback UI.

### Summary of Lifecycle Methods:

- **Mounting**: `constructor`, `componentDidMount`
- **Updating**: `shouldComponentUpdate`, `componentDidUpdate`
- **Unmounting**: `componentWillUnmount`
- **Error Handling**: `componentDidCatch`

### Notes:

- Functional components use **Hooks** (`useEffect`, `useState`, etc.) instead of these lifecycle methods to manage component lifecycles.
- **React.StrictMode** can trigger some lifecycle methods twice in development mode to help find bugs.

Understanding these lifecycle methods is essential for handling different aspects of a component's lifecycle, including initialization, rendering, updating, and cleanup.
